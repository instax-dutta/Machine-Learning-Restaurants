## Cuisine Classification

This project involves developing a machine learning model to classify various cuisines based on dish ingredients and names. The goal is to accurately identify the cuisine category for a given dish using text data.

- **Objective:** Classify dishes into different cuisine categories.
- **Techniques Used:** Natural Language Processing (NLP), Classification Algorithms.
- **Dataset:** Datasets containing dish names and ingredients.

## Location-Based Analysis

In this project, I conducted data analysis to understand restaurant performance and customer preferences based on location. This analysis helps in identifying key trends and insights that can drive business decisions.

- **Objective:** Analyze restaurant performance and customer preferences based on geographical data.
- **Techniques Used:** Data Analysis, Visualization, Geospatial Analysis.
- **Dataset:** Location-based restaurant data.

## Ratings Prediction

The ratings prediction project involves building a predictive model to forecast restaurant ratings based on historical data and customer feedback. The model aims to provide accurate ratings predictions to help restaurants improve their services.

- **Objective:** Predict restaurant ratings using historical data.
- **Techniques Used:** Regression Analysis, Machine Learning Algorithms.
- **Dataset:** Historical ratings and customer feedback data.

## Recommendation System

This project focuses on creating a recommendation system to suggest dishes and restaurants to customers based on their preferences and past behavior. The system enhances customer experience by providing personalized recommendations.

- **Objective:** Develop a recommendation system for dishes and restaurants.
- **Techniques Used:** Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, Machine Learning Algorithms.
- **Dataset:** Customer preference and behavior data.
